# Introduction to the service 

For a list of abbreviations, see Appendix.

## Overview

The Core Bioinformatics team at the Quadram Institute Bioscience
develops and maintains the infrastructure that makes bioinformatics
possible, develops commonly used workflows, and can supports
bioinformatics activities for ISP funded projects.

This report summarises the activities performed to support the activity
described in Section , and additionally contains some general notes on
how to access the platform and how to get help.

## Bioinformatics services

### IRIDA

The *Integrated Rapid Infectious Disease Analysis* (IRIDA) Platform is a
web-based application that catalogues sequencing data, and a tool that
is managed to ensure long term storage of the primary output of NGS
sequencing performed at QIB. Samples can be added into a transient
'shopping cart' collection which is used as input for analysis
pipelines. IRIDA's core functionality encompasses four main areas, the
first two being the most important:

-   data management,
-   user management and data sharing,
-   data analysis, and
-   reporting and visualization.

You can access IRIDA from the address:
[https://irida.quadram.ac.uk/irida/login](https://irida.quadram.ac.uk/irida/login), provided that you are
connected from the Institute's network or via VPN.

The documentation on how to use IRIDA is available from [our internal
wiki](https://quadram-institute.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3/article/4425077?src=2006709388)
(will require login, but it's accessible from any network).


> **Note:** IRIDA is the only platform managed by core bioinformatics
> which requires a different username and password than your usual NBI
> login. If you don't have an account on IRIDA, you can ask core
> bioinformatics to create one for you. Similarly, if you don't see among
> your projects an IRIDA project, please ask core bioinformatics to add
> you as manager or collaborator on that project.
 
### HPC

The High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster, managed by Research
Computing (RC), has a dedicated queue for QIB researchers. Core
bioinformatics maintains a set of packages and databases commonly used
in our institute.

Please, refer to the documentation and ticketing system managed by RC
for issues related to the use of the HPC:
[https://researchcomputing.nbi.ac.uk/](https://researchcomputing.nbi.ac.uk/).

### Galaxy

Galaxy is a web based framework to analyse datasets. We maintain a
dedicated instance available from this address:
[https://galaxy.quadram.ac.uk/](https://galaxy.quadram.ac.uk/), provided that you are connected from
the Institute's network or via VPN.

Galaxy Project is a world-wide community effort, and it's community is
very welcoming for beginners and produces high-quality training material
for absolute beginners: [training.galaxyproject.org](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/).

The documentation for the QIB Galaxy is available from [this wiki page](https://quadram-institute.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3/article/4424155?src=1057426372).
(will require login as described, but it's accessible from any network).

### QIB Cloud

The QIB Cloud is a resource at Quadram Institute Bioscience, which
provides cloud-based compute, storage, and analysis tools.

Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the
Internet. It involves the provision of on-demand access to a shared pool
of computing resources, such as servers, storage, databases, software
applications, and other resources, without the need for direct
management or physical presence. In cloud computing, users can access
these resources and use them to store and process data, run
applications, and perform various computing tasks. The cloud service
provider is responsible for managing and maintaining the underlying
infrastructure, including hardware, networking, and virtualization
technology. At the same time, users can focus on their specific needs
without worrying about the technical details.

In the QIB Cloud, *OpenStack* handles provisioning, and a web interface
based on *Bryn* interface allows users to control their resources. It is
modelled after the infrastructure of the [CLIMB-BIG-DATA project](https://www.climb.ac.uk).
While similar to high-performance computing
or a computer cluster, cloud computing differs in that users specify a
computer server with desired resources and can fully customize it like a
physical server. These virtual servers are called \"*Virtual Machines*
(VMs)\" and are orchestrated to resemble the specified server without
physical changes to the underlying hardware. The QIB-Cloud hardware is
installed on the NBI campus in one of the server rooms.

The documentation for the QIB Cloud is available from [this wiki page](https://quadram-institute.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3/article/4423843?src=1467860869)
(will require login as described, but it's accessible from any network).

### Training

There is training for the use of the HPC delivered by Research
Computing, and it's advertised in the intranet calendar.

Core Bioinformatics delivers topic-specific training and regular
appointments, as described in our dedicated [section of the wiki](https://quadram-institute.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3/article/10059964?src=509240794).
